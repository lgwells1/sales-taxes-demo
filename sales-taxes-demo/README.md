Problem 2: Sales Taxes

Name: Larry Wells

I was hired as a .Net dev at my current company 5 years ago. About 2.5 years ago management decided we would switch to being a Java shop. So my C# is a bit rusty, but I had fun putting this together.

For the backend I used .Net Core. For convenience I stored my products in a JSON file that I read from.

For the frontend I decided to go with React since I use it all the at work.
